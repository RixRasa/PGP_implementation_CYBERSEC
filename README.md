PGP Implementation - CYBERSEC Project

Welcome to the PGP Implementation project, "PGP_implementation_CYBERSEC." In this project, we've developed a suite of functionalities inspired by the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption and decryption system. 
Below, you'll find an overview of the key features and technologies used in this implementation.

Description

The "PGP_implementation_CYBERSEC" project aims to provide a simplified implementation of a PGP-like system. 
It allows you to perform various cryptographic operations, including key pair generation, exporting and importing keys, managing keyrings, sending and receiving encrypted messages with digital signatures, and compression. 
This project supports a combination of asymmetric and symmetric encryption algorithms to enhance the security of your communications.

Features

* Key Pair Generation: Generate and delete new pairs of keys using RSA, DSA, and ElGamal for asymmetric encryption and signature verification.
* Export and Import Keys: Export keys in PEM format for both public and private keys, and import them as needed.
* Key Management: Manage your keyrings with the ability to display all private and public keys stored.
* Secure Messaging: Send messages with encryption, digital signatures, Base64 encoding, and compression using Cast5 and AES 128 for symmetric encryption.
* Message Reception: Decrypt and verify received messages for secure communication.

Key Technologies
The following cryptographic algorithms and techniques are implemented in this project:

* Asymmetric Encryption and Signature Verification: RSA, DSA, and ElGamal
* Symmetric Encryption: Cast5 and AES 128
* ElGamal Cryptosystem (Implemented from scratch)
* User-friendly interface for ease of use
